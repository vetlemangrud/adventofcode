# adventofcode
My code for solving adventofcode.
Mostly solved in rust with some exceptions.

Keep in mind, this code is not written with maintainability or performance in mind, just solving assignments and leaving it :)
Therefore this should be viewed more as a messy notebook than a structured coding project.
If you are wondering how I solved a specific task, there is a chance that asking is a better way than trying to read the ugly code ;)
